This project is a full-stack web application that implements simple social media features. You can view it [here](https://658e6bb04abcd67d57ff6e3e--weichat.netlify.app/).

Due to limitations of render.com on which the backend is deployed, the server has a small delay for requests after a period of idling. As such, actions such as fetching all posts and creating new posts will initially take a few minutes.
